# To remember - TipCalc
Round - 2 decimal value
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#ex calculation
12% tip = 12/100=0.12
Total bill =150*0.12 = 18
Final bill = 150 + 18 = 168
secon type:
150*1.12 = 168.00000…
spliting the bill = final /5 = 168/5 =33.6
124.56+1.12=125.68
# final = "{:.2f}".format(final)
we are using formatting to round the exact 2 decimal values in the coding. So, we can easily round 2 decimal if it’s 0 or whatever.
